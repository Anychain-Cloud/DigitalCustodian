# DigitalCustodian
The Open Source Personal Digital Custodian for Blockchain, Web3 and Beyond
## Intoduction
The premise of an AnyChain Digitial Custodian (<a href="https://www.anycha.in/">ADC</a>) is simple: Empower owners to connect, communicate and transact with blockchains, owners and services on THEIR terms. ADC enables owners to integrate blockchains with their other daily activities so they can earn, spend and store value as they see fit. Personal Exchanges provide the **plumbing** required to allow an owner to easily monetize their labor, physical goods and digital assets.

AnyChain is tackling simplicity head on. While technically savvy owners can run their own ADC. AnyChain offers a hosted ADC experience for the average person. Owners control all of their data, keys and communications while AnyChain simply provides the computing resources required to support their activities in the cloud. ADC simplicity is also based on a mobile first, activity driven approach leveraging the cloud. ADC owners select the activity, actors and terms for their transactions to create a plan that is executed based on their direction. Activities are easily combined into guides that implement best practices. Those “simple” online multi-step processes are turned into guides for common blockchain activities, creating guard rails for the average user.

## How can I contribute?
AnyChain aims to elevate and empower Owners to be their best and achieve their dreams. We believe the best way to accomplish this is through simple yet secure technology geared towards economic activity. We want every person to be an Owner who benefits from their personal autonomy. We hope that you are as excited over the benefits of ownership as we are.

## So Join Us

As an open source project we need developers, partnerships with blockchains and partnerships with exchanges to bring our vision to life. As a start up we need investment to keep the wheels turning. If you are interested in volunteering on the project, partnering with us or investing in the future of decentralized economics please email [info@anycha.in](mailto:info@anycha.in). Together we can build a future based on ownership and personal freedom.
