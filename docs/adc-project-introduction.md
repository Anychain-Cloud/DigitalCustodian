**ADC - The AnyChain Digital Custodian** is an open source project (MPL 2.0) designed to allow Owners to connect, communicate and transact with any blockchain, owner or service on their terms from their phone. Our mission is to empower people to command their personal economies through digital assets (crypto/NFTs/etc.) and Web3 services. We want people to be Owners and entrepreneurs instead of users. While ownership requires responsibility, like hosting an ADC environment or paying someone to do it, owners gain freedom and control over how they connect, communicate and transact.

**Core Project Principles**



1. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Built for the Average Person</span> - Blockchains can be complicated for non-techies. We want non-techies to feel comfortable integrating blockchain into their daily activities. This means a mobile-first approach and guides that walk owners through common best practices.
2. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Fail Secure</span> - Since we are dealing with people’s valuable assets we want to limit potential theft so a fail secure mentality is required. This approach must be coupled with secure backup and recovery processes to minimize the potential for loss.
3. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Identity not Anonymity</span> - Identity is fundamental to secure transactions. If you can’t properly identify and authenticate the people and services you want to interact and transact with then you can’t be secure. There are many valid reasons for anonymity online but we believe a strong assertion of identity coupled with privacy through encryption is the best path for securely connecting, communicating and transacting.
4. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Transparent Key Management</span> - The average person has no idea how to properly secure the private keys that control their digital assets so they shouldn’t be expected to. The AnyChain Digital Custodian UI (DC UI) is designed to make key management simple, secure and transparent for Owners.
5. <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Protean Security</span> - Common security practices can create a static attack surface for hackers and bad actors. ADC is designed to leverage asymmetric key cryptography with every entity performing key exchanges with their connections. These exchanges are performed transparently and keys are regularly rotated, creating a constantly evolving attack surface.

**Join us!**

AnyChain aims to elevate and empower Owners to be their best and achieve their dreams. We believe the best way to accomplish this is through simple yet secure technology geared towards economic activity. When Owners assume the responsibility for their own ADC environment they gain control over their activities. We want every person to be an Owner who benefits from their personal autonomy. We hope that you are as excited over the benefits of ownership as we are. Please join us on this journey to empower people to be their best through economic freedom.
